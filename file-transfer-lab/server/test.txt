I want the newline \
 to show up explicitly when printing a string retrieved from elsewhere. So if the string is 'abc\
def' I don't want this to happen:

>>> print(line)
abc
def
but instead this:

>>> print(line)
abc\
def
Is there a way to modify print, or modify the argument, or maybe another function entirely, to accomplish this?
